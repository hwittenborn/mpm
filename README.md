## Overview ##
mpm is a package manager for the [MPR](https://dur.hunterwittenborn.com/), making it easier to obtain and build PKGBUILDs to install packages.

Currently, mpm has (and plans for) the following features:

- Searching
- Installing
- Updating
- Cloning (to-do)

## Installation and usage
mpm can be installed [directly from the MPR](https://dur.hunterwittenborn.com/packages/mpm).

Help with available commands can also be found after installation with `mpm --help`.

A [Matrix space](https://matrix.to/#/!KOdBeHhHDQPQNLgioI:hunterwittenborn.com?via=hunterwittenborn.com&via=matrix.org&via=nerv.com.au) is available for assistance with makedeb, the MPR, and contribution help.
