This is a basic list of packages that are known to work from the AUR and Arch Linux repositories.

This list is likely incomplete, and more are likely to work.

If a package you use isn't listed and you'd like to know if it works - see if it works! If you do, it would be greatly appreciated if you could report back:

1. If it works, or,
2. If it doesn't work, make an issue on what didn't - dependencies, functions in the PKGBUILD, etc.
